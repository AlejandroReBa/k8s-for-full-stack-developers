# Webinar: A Closer Look at Kubernetes

This folder is for the tutorial [A Closer Look at Kubernetes](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/webinar-series-a-closer-look-at-kubernetes), with some changes that work with recent versions of Kubernetes.

This tutorial is very clear and no extra notes are required. Just remember that the _Service_ you create at the beggining of the tutorial is working in the rest of it thanks to the labels :)
